The legend for the floor plan is as follows:

-2  ->  This will be in the shortest path array only if the unit is non-traversable
-1  ->  empty space (represents the "outside" of the house)
0   ->  a traversable space (floor level 1, bare floor)
1   ->  a traversable space (floor level 2, short carpet)
2   ->  a traversable space (floor level 3, high carpet)
3   ->  an untraversable space (either object or wall)
4   ->  a door, open
5   ->  a door, closed
6   ->  charging station
